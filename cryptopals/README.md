This is my attempt, in rust, for the challenges at https://cryptopals.com/

My solutions are grouped first by set and then by challenge, and contain test cases to validate that they work (at the very least, I test against examples provided by the challenges list, but I've also taken the liberty of writing additional test cases where appropriate).

To test all of my solutions, run `cargo test`.

You are forewarned that my test cases may include plain-text solutions to puzzles.
